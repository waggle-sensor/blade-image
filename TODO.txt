TODO

add waggle-firewall service
- ensure runs before dnsmasq, k3s, docker, others as in WSN

add local docker registry service
- do we need the docker mirrors?

Install the waggle k3s shutdown service

figure out how k3s is installed and if we can do it better then having the k3s_install pre-downloaded
- download it in the docker / ISO setup and have it copied to the ISO and then put on systems 

setup k3s with same K3S_CLUSTER_SECRET=4tX0DUZ0uQknRtVUAKjt as WSN just in case we ever have a agents
- k3s service changes (this would need to be a systemd override file, which means we need to be able to create "end filesystem" )

NetworkManager lan0 configuration to the 2nd ethernet port (not the uplink one)
- try to switch the lan0 configuration to be within NetworkManager system-connections just like WSN
- why do we have a setting in /etc/network for static IPs ?
- IT IS BY DESIGN (see readme) THAT NETWORK IS DISABLED BY DEFAULT, we should still have the network system-connections in ROOTFS for when eventually
  the network is unlocked
- investigate how to do static IPs with the system-connections (in replacement of the stuff outlined in README)

configure journalctl, dump rsyslog
- change the waggle-init from rsyslog to journalctl (remove the rsyslog config) (this may arleady just work)
- make sure its on the large partition (or /rw maybe if we have alot of space) and leave a bunch of free space

setup the apt sources to match that of the WSN
- evaluate if we need to override the apt sources.list file

update the entire readme
- specifically the unlock registration part
- the iso file name and version break down (if its changed)
- the network section (restore and static IP)
- and how the required_deb package list is updated

validate NVidia GPU support for running containers
- do we need that k3s config change to use the NVidia runtime

disable the apt auto upgrade service timers
- apt-daily-upgrade
- apt-daily
- motd

remove items from firstboot script
- do the overlay as part of the ROOTFS
- others?

ensure sshd_config doesnt allow password login
- actually ensure firewall blocks it completely
- other nx sshd settings

make sure rsyslog is disabled or not installed

update k3s to latest 1.20 version (v1.20.15+k3s1)
- this includes the k3s install script (follow the change done in rpi)

add the waggle user support
- ability fo the `waggle` user to login and get access to waggle home space

figure out why the "set to +w" for root is not working for all files we copy in pressed

------------------------------------
DONE
------------------------------------
Ensure the root user password is the same as on the NX
 - actually lets leave this different for security reasons (unchanged)
