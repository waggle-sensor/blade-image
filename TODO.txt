TODO

scan all the "extra packages" to be sure we have the latest version
- figure out how we scanned and created that list before and re-do it
- look how i did it for the nvidia packages as an example
- create a vm with the same .ISO and see what the delta in packages would be... should be the same?
 - look at everything that we already had in our list of things to install and compare against what we install in the
   WSN node and see what we are missing, or can remove.
   it will probably be helpful to identify which of the packages is a dependency of others. as the deb list is all dependencies

refresh the nvidia package list too

figure out the additional debian packages we have added to the NX image that also need to be added
- bluez ?

add waggle-firewall service
- ensure runs before dnsmasq, k3s, docker, others as in WSN
install all other waggle specific packages that make sense

Ensure the root user password is the same as on the NX

Install the waggle k3s shutdown service

figure out how k3s is installed and if we can do it better then having the k3s_install pre-downloaded
- download it in the docker / ISO setup and have it copied to the ISO and then put on systems 

setup k3s with same K3S_CLUSTER_SECRET=4tX0DUZ0uQknRtVUAKjt as WSN just in case we ever have a agents
- k3s service changes (this would need to be a systemd override file, which means we need to be able to create "end filesystem" )

NetworkManager lan0 configuration to the 2nd ethernet port (not the uplink one)
- try to switch the lan0 configuration to be within NetworkManager system-connections just like WSN
- why do we have a setting in /etc/network for static IPs ?

configure journalctl, dump rsyslog
- change the waggle-init from rsyslog to journalctl (remove the rsyslog config) (this may arleady just work)

add the new bk registration with the file locked the same way as the current registration
- needing a manual unlock, by the installer

update authorized keys to match what is WSN

setup the apt sources to match that of the WSN
